## Overview

**PseudoGatewayAPI** is the gateway server of [PseudoRESTAPI](https://github.com/netervati/pseudo-rest-api) for interacting with external clients. Client apps can access models with their model names as the URL path (e.g. `/officers`) and do CRUD operations using HTTP requests. More information can be read in the [documentation](https://www.pseudorestapi.com/docs).
